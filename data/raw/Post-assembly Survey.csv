1,4,5,5,4,2,5,it was very fun lol <3
3,4,5,3,4,3,3,Would be useful in real life general use
4,5,4,4,4,2,3,I would be likely to use this over paper instructions
6,4,2,4,4,2,4,tracking had to be forced into position rather than being a guide on position
8,3,2,3,4,3,3,It felt quite useful after I stopped using the tracking stuff
9,5,2,4,3,3,2,I often preferred looking past the screen over listing the screen. Names of parts on screen were useful for getting the right part
