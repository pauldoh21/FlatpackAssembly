	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is emerged in the last decade as a potentially disruptive technology capable of superimposing virtual objects generated by a computer onto the real world surrounding the user. By using see-through displays, AR systems make the user perceive both the real surrounding environment and virtual elements in a consistent way with regard to user point of view and virtual content size. The recent developments of low-cost AR technologies and mixed reality (MR) devices such as Google Glass, Microsoft Hololens, Vuzix, and many others are capturing interest of users and researchers, suggesting that AR could be the next springboard for technological innovation as also highlighted but its inclusion as enabling technology of Industry 4.0 paradigm. However, the AR is not as young as it seems. The concept of AR was formulated in the 1960s, and the first commercial AR tools appeared in the late 1980s. This chapter presents an overview of AR, the historical evolution since its first appearance, its usage in the most relevant domains including the emerging instance of Mobile/Wearable AR applications, the technical challenges in implementing AR systems, as well as main technological and applicative trends for the near future.},

abstract="Although there has been great speculation about the potential of augmented reality (AR) in manufacturing applications, there have been very few empirical studies that assess the effectiveness of the technology. This chapter describes an experiment that tested the relative effectiveness of AR instructions in computer-assisted assembly. The AR solution displayed task information in the user's field of view (FOV) as 3D objects registered with the workspace. The presentation demonstrates the exact execution of a procedural step. Three traditional instructional media approaches were compared with the AR system: a printed manual, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) using a monitor-based display, and CAI utilizing a head-mounted display (HMD). Results indicate that overlaying 3D instructions on the actual work pieces reduced the error rate for an assembly task by 82{\%}, particularly diminishing cumulative errors, errors due to previous assembly mistakes. Measurement of the mental effort indicated decreased mental effort in the AR condition, suggesting some of the mental calculation of the assembly task is offloaded to the system. The results indicate that an AR system for computer-assisted assembly can improve worker performance.",

However, user interaction with AR has not been well understood in the current literature, which may result in poor usability, occupational hazards, and low acceptance. To bridge this gap, this study introduced cognitive ergonomics theory to design and develop an AR application for improving the kinaesthetic performance of construction workers conducting onsite assembly tasks. The methodology of this study is three-fold. First, articles in relation to cognitive ergonomics were reviewed to propose a unique cognitive model that reveals the cognitive mechanisms of construction workers, including human information processing, selective attention, and attention resources. Second, the characteristics of existing AR application functions were synthesised to develop a customised and user-friendly wearable AR application that aligns with the identified cognitive mechanisms. Third, a rebar-tying experiment was conducted to validate the developed AR application. The results indicate that the experimenters instructed by the application can complete the task independently without the need to seek after expert assistance; the application has a potential to foster the skill development of construction workers and enhance their kinaesthetic performance; and the proposed cognitive model and the AR development principles are well aligned from the perspective of cognitive ergonomics, which could promote the uptake of wearable AR in the construction industry.},

Recently, augmented reality (AR) has gained increasing attention as a new way to provide user support and assistance for guiding assembly. To date, although comprehensive studies have compared the effectiveness of augmented reality instructions on Head-Mounted Displays and projectors, only a few investigate the AR instructions on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by comparing mobile AR instructions to paper-based instructions using a Lego assembly task. Two groups of participants were asked to either use AR instructions or paper-based instructions. Their task effectiveness, efficiency, cognitive load, and motivation were measured. Results indicate that participants who used mobile AR instructions made fewer errors compared to participants who used paper instructions. Furthermore, mobile AR instructions do not hinder task efficiency, cognitive load, and motivation. This study adds empirical evidence to the usability of mobile AR instructions and may help instructional designers gain insights about differences in mobile AR instructions and paper instructions.},

It was divided into a couple of stages. It consisted of specifying the problem and requirements, designing the system, implementing and integrating it, and testing the system. Identifying problems and requirements was conducted through an online questionnaire and related works study. The graphics tool used was 3D Studio Max. Unity3d was used to develop the system with the software library from Qualcomm’s Vuforia for the AR implementation. The results show the mobile application called ARsembly. It serves as the early stage of concept model as it only assists the simple assembly. Through system testing performed by both researchers and end-users, ARsembly is proven to be useful and helpful in learning and performing furniture assembly.},

    Quick Outline was originally designed for VR, so it supports Instanced Stereo rendering and MSAA. It looks great in any HMD, and it won’t impact the frame rate.
    
    - Designed for VR (including single pass)
    - Supports MSAA
    - Compatible with post-processing stack
    - Multiple outline modes

	abstract = {Modern society is increasingly permeated by realities parallel to the real one. The so-called virtual reality is now part of both current habits and many activities carried out during the day. Virtual reality (VR) is, in turn, related to the concept of augmented reality (AR). It represents a technology still in solid expansion but which was created and imagined several decades ago. This paper presents an overview of augmented reality, starting from its conception, passing through its main applications, and providing essential information. Part of the article will be devoted to hardware and software components used in AR systems. The last part of the paper highlights the limitations related to the design of these systems, the shortcomings in this area, and the possible future fields of application of this extraordinary technological innovation.},
